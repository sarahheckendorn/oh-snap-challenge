				<p>Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. and attack the Romulans. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Ensign Babyface! Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship.</p>
